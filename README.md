# Python Reference Notebook & Best Practices
This repository is prepared by exploring all possible resources in net. All the problems are solved with different problem solving approaches. Best practices are made by consolidating the unique and short approaches on all frequently used problems.

I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient. If you would like to make any comments, then please feel free to email me at eswarpoluri@gmail.com
